- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Tayou @tayou11 and i am currently a data science student at the mercyhurst university.
- 👀 I’m interested in data visualization and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning big data and how to use and arrange big data, relational and non-relational databases and their pros and cons and also doing some research on how to improve a schools acceptance rate using machine learning (neural networks and logistic regression) based on previous information about enrolement.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that help in building and providing machine learning models and visualize how data manipulation can improve decision making and reduce costs in businesses.
